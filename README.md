# Resources Bridge

`Resources Bridge` is a tool for sending and requesting files from Mac on iOS devices.
Read and write your Mac's files in a sync manner like they are on your iPhone.

‚ö†Ô∏è Currently this project is in early alfa stage and it's a subject for improvements.

## Requirements

* Swift `5.2`
* iOS `11.0`
* macOS `10.13`

## Install via [SwiftPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/eugenebokhan/ResourcesBridge.git",
         .upToNextMinor(from: "0.0.4"))
```

## How To Use

First of all you need to launch the [`Monitor`](ResourcesBridgeMonitor/) app on your Mac. It is used to receive and send files from iOS devices and handle all local file management.

After the `Monitor` app is launched, you may call one of the following functions on iPhone or iPad:

* Init Bridge

  ```Swift
  let bridge = try ResourcesBridge()
  ```

* Start session and try to connect to `Monitor` automatically

  ```Swift
  bridge.tryToConnect()
  ```

* Abort connection and stop session

  ```Swift
  bridge.abortConnection()
  ```

* Wait for connection synchronously

  ```Swift
  try bridge.waitForConnection()
  ```

* Write resource on Mac

  ```Swift
  bridge.writeResource(_ resource: Data,
                       at remotePath: String,
                       progressHandler: ((Double) -> Void)? = nil) throws
  ```

  * `progressHandler`: `read` / `write` functions are designed to be synchronous, but you may pass a progress handler that will report progress on other dispatch queue for debug purposes.
  * `remotePath` is an absolute path to the file on Mac.

* Read resource from Mac

  The logic is similar to the `write` func.

  ```Swift
  bridge.readResource(at remotePath: String,
                      progressHandler: ((Double) -> Void)? = nil) throws -> Data
  ```

## Info.plist configuration

In order for `Resources Bridge` to work when running on iOS 14, you will have to include two keys in your app's Info.plist file.
The keys are `Privacy - Local Network Usage Description` (`NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`) and `Bonjour services` (`NSBonjourServices`).
For the privacy key, include a human-readable description of what benefit the user gets by allowing your app to access devices on the local network.
The Bonjour services key is an array of service types that your app will browse for. For `Resources Bridge`, he value of this key should be `_ResourcesBridge._tcp`.

**If you do not configure the above keys properly, then `Resources Bridge` won't work.**
